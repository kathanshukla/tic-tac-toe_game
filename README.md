# tic-tac-toe_game

**Overview**
This Python project implements the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game continues until one player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, or if the entire grid is filled without a winner, resulting in a tie.

**Features**
- Players can choose their symbols ('X' or 'O').
- The current state of the board is displayed after each move.
- The game checks for a winner after each move and declares the winner.
- In case the entire board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
- User inputs are validated to ensure they are within the valid range and available.
